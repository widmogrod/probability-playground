# Probability Playground
## Introduction
The main goal of this project is to explore applications of probability in real business situations that may be seen in daily life.

## Examples 
### Amazon Mechanical Turk and probability of random consensus on decision
Amazon Mechanical Turk provides the capability to distribute simple tasks to humans to solve. 
This capability is also known under the name of crowdsourcing. 

Because is hard to verify the quality of work product in such setup, the question arises: 
**What is the probability that in n-tasks workers deciding on random, will reach consensus on the same decision?**

To find an answer to this question please take a look at example [aws_mechanical_turk_probability_of_consensus_monte_carlo_test.go](/example/aws_mechanical_turk_probability_of_consensus_monte_carlo_test.go])

// You can read more in the Internet, what I want to highlight is that
// birthday paradox help to answer question what is probability of random hash collision.
// Important to have in back of your mind when building systems that are based on checksums, and randomly generated hashes.
// In short, such collision is more probable that you can think of ;)

		res += r

	//		log_b(a) = c    <==>   a = b^c
	//
	// We have computed value `c`, that is stored in `res` variable,
	// To compute it we use natiral logarithm function which base `b` is `e`
	// to retrieve value `a` from logarithm, we need rise `b` to power of `c`.
	// In our case that's simply invocation of a function math.Exp()
	//
	// Rest of computation is calculation of complement.

// There is alternative way to compute theoretical value of probability of collision
// It's writen concisely in [John D. Cook blog post](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/01/30/general-birthday-problem/)
// which I recommend you to read.
//
// Alternative method translate mathematical equation one-to-one
// with addition of mathematical brilliance to overcome floating point underflow :)
//
// Solution to birthday problem can be written as:
//
// 		P(k) = 1-(n!/(n-k)!/n^k)			[E1]
//
// You can see a lot of factorials, for even for "small numbers" like 365,
// factorial of this number is huge and when this number used to divide by another big number
// there is chance of underflow occurring, to solve this we can use use logarithms.
//
// Golang has function Lgamma, that calculates logarithm value of gamma function.
// Gamma function is defined as Î“=(n-1)! which is exactly like factorial but minus one.
// We use this function in calculation bellow to compute equation [E1] using log gamma.
